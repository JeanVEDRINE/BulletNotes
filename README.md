# BulletNotes

http://www.bulletnotes.io/

## User Guide

https://github.com/NickBusey/BulletNotes/wiki

## Goal

An open-source, note taking app.

### Focus

* Privacy
* Data Portability
* Simplicity

## Motivations

I have become fully reliant on Workflowy for just about every aspect of my life. I don't feel comfortable continuing to use a closed, private platform for this. Also, the rate of development of new features seems to have come to a complete halt at Workflowy. There are features I want, and have been trying to hack in via [Workflowier](http://workflowier.com/) but this is far from ideal.
