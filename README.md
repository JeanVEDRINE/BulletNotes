# Note.d

## User Guide

https://github.com/NickBusey/noted/wiki

## Hosted Version

https://noted-prod.herokuapp.com/

## Goal

A fully featured, OSS clone of Workflowy.

## Reason

I have become fully reliant on Workflowy for just about every aspect of my life. I don't feel comfortable continuing to use a closed, private platform for this. Also, the rate of development of new features seems to have come to a complete halt at Workflowy. There are features I want, and have been trying to hack in via [Workflowier](http://workflowier.com/) but this is far from ideal.

## Planned Feature List

* Public Lists (There are many more planned features, but they live in a Note.d list, once Public Lists are done, this will link to the planned feature list.)
